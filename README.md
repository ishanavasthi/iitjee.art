Welcome to my website powered by [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (which is a serverless computing platform provided by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)) and the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api).         

I have combined the cutting-edge technologies of Cloudflare Workers and the robust functionality of the Google Drive API to bring a seamless and efficient experience for indexing the contents of my Google Drive.

With my innovative solution, I can effortlessly organize, view and search through my files, folders, and documents stored in [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/).

By leveraging the power of Cloudflare Workers, I have optimized the indexing process, ensuring lightning-fast response times and reducing latency. 

With Cloudflare's global network and the Google Drive API, it is reliable and scalable platform that can present all files of Google Drive, ensuring a smooth and efficient file-browsing.

## Inspiration

* I found myself struggling with the laggy video player of Google Drive on web.
* Also, in the mobile app of Google Drive. The file is completely downloaded before previewing, which is very annoying.
* After building this, I never had to worry about my video lectures. I could stream them from any device with a password, which only I knew, which is way more easier than signing in to Google account, then confirming the prompt on your original device... too many steps.
* So whenever I was on the go I never had to worry about my studies, I just visited this site.


## Features
* Preview many file types within the browser (Eg. PDF,Video and Audio Files).
* Audio and Video Player using [plyr.io](https://plyr.io/) which is better than the original player of Google Drive.
* One can even drag and drop the download link to other media players such as [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and [Pot Player](https://potplayer.tv/) to play videos locally (without even downloading completely), which is not possible with Google Drive.
* PDF Viewer using [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).
* Ability to download files at high speed with resumable links. (Links that don't expire after sometime and can be used perfectly with download managers.)
* The changes (addition/deletion/rename/moving of files) made in Google Drive are reflected here instantly.
* Ability to search for a file in the whole folder including sub-directories.
* Password protected the whole website to restrict access by everyone.
* Is accessible from every browser and device, no need to login to Google Account. Now there is an option to share folder links in Google Drive, but either it is visible to everyone or we can add specific email ids. No option for VISIBLE TO EVERYONE WHO ENTERS CORRECT PASSWORD.
* Experience the convenience of a well-organized and easily searchable Google Drive.

## Deployment
The project is live at [https://iitjee.art](https://iitjee.art/0:/). Please visit this link it will ask for a password, which should be already shared beforehand, if not then can be obtained by mailing me [here](mailto:hello@ishanavasthi.in?cc=heyavasthi@gmail.com&subject=Password%20for%20iitjee.art%3A).
